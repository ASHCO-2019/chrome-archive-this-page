## Internet Archive "Save a Page" Plug-In for Chrome

The Internet Archive has a [feature](https://archive.org/web/) where you can submit a URL, which is then archived on the spot. This is a Chrome plug-in to provide access to that functionality... when you're on a page you want to save, simply right-click to archive it. Never lose a page again!

### Installation

This repo holds the source code. The Chrome CRX package files are kept in [another repo](https://github.com/lintool/chrome-archive-this-page-crx), but you can download the latest version (0.1) [here](https://github.com/lintool/chrome-archive-this-page-crx/blob/master/chrome-archive-this-page-v0.1.crx?raw=true).

To install the Chrome extension:

1. Download the CRX package from the link above.
2. Open a new tab in Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar (omnibox).
3. Drag the CRX package you downloaded from step (1) into the tab.
4. That's it!

### Usage

It's simple! Whenever you are on a page you would like to add to the Internet Archive, right click on any empty part of the screen: you'll see a context menu item that says "Save this page to the Internet Archive". Click on that... and vola, the page is automatically added to the Internet Archive!
